# Provisioning your IBM LinuxONE Virtual Server
## Follow these steps to setup your IBM LinuxONE virtual server for the first time.
* If you have not yet registered for an account, return to [step 1](./1_register.md) for instructions. 
* If you have already provisioned your virtual server, choose the correct step 3 instructions page based on whether you are using either [Windows](./3_windows_connect.md) or [Mac](./3_mac_connect.md).

1) Sign in to the [IBM LinuxONE Community Cloud website](https://linuxone.cloud.marist.edu/#/login) using Firefox or Google Chrome:

8) Wait for the server to instantiate. This may take up a few minutes... \
Don't be alarmed when the 'Status' of the virtual server is `UNKNOWN`. After some time it will change to `spawning` and then `ACTIVE` - which means it is now ready!

## You are now ready to connect to the server. Choose the correct step 3 instructions page based on whether you are using [Windows](./3_windows_connect.md) or [Mac](./3_mac_connect.md).
