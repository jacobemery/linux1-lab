# Connecting to your Server - Mac
## Follow these steps to connect to your virtual server via Secure Shell (SSH) on Mac using the Terminal.
* If you haven't provisioned your virtual server yet, see [step 2](./2_provision.md) for instructions.
* If you're a Windows user, go [here](./3_windows_connect.md) instead.
1) Get your IP address for your virtual server [here](https://linuxone.cloud.marist.edu/#/instance) from IBM LinuxONE Community Cloud.
2) Open the 'Terminal' application. It can be found in 'Finder' under 'Applications/Utilities':

3) Stick with me here, this part's a little tricky. If you need help please ask me! In the terminal prompt, type in the following command, but substitute in the path to your private key file that you created when provisioning your virtual server:
```
chmod 400 <path-to-key-file>
```
For example:
```
chmod 400 ~/Downloads/test1234.pem
```
4) Type in the following command, but substitute in your IP address and the path to your private key file:
```
ssh linux1@<ip-address> -i <path-to-key-file>
```
For example:
```
ssh linux1@148.100.77.96 -i ~/Downloads/test1234.pem
```
5) After doing so you will see the following message:
```
The authenticity of host '148.100.77.96 (148.100.77.96)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:FwHNWt0fu76CthKGSQfBTt4QvfrpoEgW+MMG0jPCQ7g.
This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:170: 148.100.77.184
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```
Type in `yes` and hit the Enter key.

You should see the following text appear:
